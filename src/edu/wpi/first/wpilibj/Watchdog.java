/**
 * Watchdog timer class.
 * The watchdog timer is designed to keep the robots safe. The idea is that the robot program must
 * constantly "feed" the watchdog otherwise it will shut down all the motor outputs. That way if a
 * program breaks, rather than having the robot continue to operate at the last known speed, the
 * motors will be shut down.
 *
 * This is serious business.  Don't just disable the watchdog.  You can't afford it!
